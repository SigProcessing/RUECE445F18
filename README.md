# ECE 445: Machine Learning for Engineers (Topics in ECE)

In Fall 2018, I offered an undergraduate-level class entitled "Machine Learning for Engineers" in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University--New Brunswick](http://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu). The learning outcomes of this class included:

- Mastery of the basic terminology and concepts in machine learning
- Understanding of the basic building blocks of practical machine learning systems
- Mathematical understanding of commonly used machine learning algorithms
- Ability to develop basic machine learning systems in Jupyter/Python
- Recognition of common pitfalls that come with machine learning systems

As part of the hands-on component of this class, students were required to submit mini Jupyter exercises that reinforced the theoretical concepts learned in class. This repository provides my solutions to these exercises. The best way to view these solutions is using [Jupyter's nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), although GitHub's own notebook renderer does an adequate job of displaying many of these notebooks.
